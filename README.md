### Description

This code allows you to create timers, countdowns, countdowns to a specific time, and display the current time. Each of these features comes with a browser source for OBS, which you can preview in your browser and configure to your needs.

One of the additional functions of this repository is the ability to modify the timers through events sent from a StreamDeck or a similar tool using websockets.

### About the Code

I have chosen to publish this code to make it accessible for free, openly, and as open-source. These codes I have developed have helped me continue learning, and since it doesn't entail any financial cost for me, there will also be no paid features created. It will be open to anyone who wants to use it and collaborate in improving the code.

The codes have been created with my current knowledge and may contain errors or areas that need improvement. I have worked on this code in my free time.
